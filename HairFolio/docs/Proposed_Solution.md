# Proposed Solution

**Background:**  
The Barbershop Financial Tracker centralizes transaction and expense recording, automates summaries, and provides trend analysis.

## Solution Overview

- Generate monthly summaries: income, expenses, net profit, customer count
- Track trends: most preferred service, monthly growth, profit vs expenses
- Optional: habit-tracker style dashboard for easy visualization

## Design Philosophy
- Manual input only (no automation required)
- Offline-first, mobile-friendly
- Minimal, intuitive UI
- Incremental development: start with core features, then add analysis & visualizations
